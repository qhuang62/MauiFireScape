# Modeling Fire Dynamics, Human Behavior, and Power Supply in Complex Systems Using Agent-Based Models (ABMs)

This repository contains the NetLogo model and supporting materials for the project **“Modeling Fire Dynamics, Human Behavior, and Power Supply in Complex Systems Using ABMs.”**  
The project investigates **wildfire propagation**, **cascading power grid failures**, and **human evacuation dynamics** under climate-driven extreme events.

This work was originally developed as a **CAS 570** final project and **won the CSDMS Travel Scholarship** to present a poster at the **CSDMS 2025 Annual Meeting** (May 13–15, 2025, University of Colorado Boulder).
